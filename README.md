Features covered:
- An user can register using his email, a selected password and an user name. The user name has to be unique.
- One user can publish messages no longer than 160 characters.
- One user can follow what other users publish. When the user accesses the application, he will see the messages
published by the users he follow.
- Everyone can see the users followed by any user.
- Everyone can see the users that follow one user.

We also want to allow other developers to build their own applications using our public information. So, we provide
an API access to allow:
- See one user messages.
- See the users followed by one user.
- See the users that follow one user.
